## Issues

- Restrict New Recipe to be a user only action (controller restriction)
- Associate a Recipe with a user (id)
- User can sign out
- Clean up the default Devise sign in page (superfluous Sign Up link)
- In "spec/features/visitor_views_recipes_spec.rb", both specs have to visit
  '/' before they can interact with the nav bar. Better way to do this?
  Include visit '/' in a rails_helper before example block?
